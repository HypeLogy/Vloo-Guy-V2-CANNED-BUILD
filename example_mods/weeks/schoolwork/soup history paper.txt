Between 1492 and 1504, Christopher Columbus made four trips to the Caribbean and back to Spain. Though he thought he was off the coast of Asia, he was in fact all mainly around modern-day Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and some of the smaller islands of the Lesser Antilles.

As has been acknowledged previously, Columbus was a particularly brutal explorer, even by the standards of his day. To take one example, Columbus's son Ferdinand described this process for collecting either a minimum quantity of gold or 25 pounds of cotton from the local Arawak people of Hispaniola:

"Whenever an Indian delivered his tribute, he was to receive a brass or copper token which he must wear about his neck as proof that he had made his payment; any Indian found without such a token was to be punished." What was the punishment? No undebatable evidence survives, but there is evidence that despair led to mass suicides, so it could not have been pleasant.

Columbus was arrested and shipped back to Spain in chains between his third and fourth voyages, but Ferdinand and Isabella released him and allowed him one more voyage to attempt to circumnavigate the world. However, he was shipwrecked in Jamaica (still thinking himself near China or India). He survived there more than a year, and in 1504 returned to Spain and retirement. He died two years later, and by 1511 Spain controlled all of the Greater Antilles.
